3,Can I join the Inhaler Recycling Scheme?,Following a review of our Complete the Cycle Scheme GSK decided to discontinue it from the end of September 2020. Complete the Cycle
4,Can I have my inhalers collected?,"Unfortunately no. The CTC closed at the end of September. Since introducing Complete the Cycle in 2011, we have recovered over two million inhalers and demonstrated that there is interest from healthcare professionals, pharmacists and patients in reducing inhaler carbon emissions. We are proud of what it has achieved as the first national scheme of its kind but it cannot reach the necessary scale as a bespoke, standalone scheme.

We remain committed to inhaler recovery in the UK. In order to support the ambitious NHS environmental targets to reduce inhaler carbon emissions by 50% over the next ten years, we believe there needs to be a focus on a wider, joint-working approach across industry, rather than our own stand-alone approach. We believe working together will have a bigger environmental impact."
